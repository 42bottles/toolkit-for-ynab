YNAB Enhanced
=============

YNAB Enhanced is a general purpose YNAB enhancing chrome extension. Have it your way!

YNAB have released an exciting new web version. Lots of power users of the older
versions are asking for options that are easily implemented in a browser extension.
Rather than ask the YNAB team to implement these features, let's just do it
ourselves!

You can do two things at the moment with this:

- Make the calculator work like YNAB4, e.g. this:

- Make the Age of Money calculation hide itself.

Both of these are configurable with options in the extension options page.

This is early days, but I'm excited!

Next Up in Priorities
---------------------

- Unhide the Check Number field (seems to have gone missing? Can't seem to find it on the page.)
- Add running totals

Features Under Consideration
----------------------------

- Walled months (e.g. being able to categorise income as Income : Available in <whatever month you want> and have the money stay there)
