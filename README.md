YNAB Enhanced
=============

YNAB Enhanced is a general purpose YNAB enhancing chrome extension. Have it your way!

YNAB have released an exciting new web version. Lots of power users of the older
versions are asking for options that are easily implemented in a browser extension.
Rather than ask the YNAB team to implement these features, let's just customise do it
ourselves!

Right now this extension only does one thing, which is to hide the Age of Money
calculation on your budget screen. Pull requests for other features are welcome!

This is early days, but I'm excited!

Next Up in Priorities
---------------------

- Build an options panel so people can turn features on and off as they get added to suit them
- Unhide the Check Number field
- Add running totals

Features Under Consideration
----------------------------

- Walled months (e.g. being able to categorise income as Income : Available in <whatever month you want> and have the money stay there)
